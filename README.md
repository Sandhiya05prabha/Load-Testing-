**DESCRIPTION**:

In this task, load testing was performed to evaluate the performance of a web application under simulated user load. The main objective of this task is to analyze how the system behaves when multiple users access the application simultaneously and to identify performance-related issues such as response delay or failures.

The load testing process involved configuring multiple virtual users and sending repeated HTTP requests to the target server. During execution, important performance metrics such as average response time, minimum and maximum response time, throughput, and error percentage were observed and analyzed.

Apache JMeter was used to conduct this load testing activity. JMeter helps simulate concurrent users and provides detailed performance reports like the Summary Report, which clearly shows system behavior under load. Based on the results, the application handled the simulated load successfully with zero errors, indicating stable performance.

This task provided practical understanding of load testing concepts, performance analysis, and the use of testing tools to evaluate system reliability under stress conditions.
